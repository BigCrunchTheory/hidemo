```

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

To build and run using Docker:

```bash
docker build -t my-app .

# Run the container

```

The containerized application can be deployed to any platform that supports Docker, including:

- AWS ECS
- Google Cloud Run
- Azure Container Apps

### DIY Deployment

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

```
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json (or pnpm-lock.yaml, or bun.lockb)
├── build/
│   ├── client/    # Static assets
│   └── server/    # Server-side code
```

## Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) already configured for a simple default starting experience. You can use whatever CSS framework you prefer.

## GitHub Pages deployment

This repo includes a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the project and publishes `build/client` to the `gh-pages` branch on push to `main`.

Steps:

1. Push the repository to GitHub and make sure the default branch is `main`.
2. The action `.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml` will run on push and publish the site.
3. In GitHub Settings → Pages, set the source to the `gh-pages` branch (the workflow will create it).

Note: `vite.config.ts` sets `base: './'` so assets are relative and the site will work when served from GitHub Pages.
